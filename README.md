# LLM Certification for Financial Services

Automated LLM model certification pipeline using [Langfuse](https://langfuse.com) experiments and open-source financial evaluation datasets. Powered by [ClickHouse](https://clickhouse.com) as the analytics backend.

**The problem:** Certifying a new LLM (e.g., Claude Sonnet 4.6, GPT-4o) for use in financial services takes weeks of manual testing - sending prompts, collecting responses, scoring accuracy, writing compliance reports. Model risk management teams need standardized, reproducible evidence before approving models for production.

**This pipeline:** Load golden financial datasets into Langfuse, run them against any model through a single command, automatically score with financial evaluators, and export results for compliance reports. What took 2 weeks becomes 1 day.

## Architecture

```

## Prerequisites

- Python 3.11+
- [uv](https://docs.astral.sh/uv/) (recommended) or pip
- A [Langfuse](https://cloud.langfuse.com) instance (Cloud free tier or self-hosted)
- An LLM API key (OpenAI, Anthropic, or any OpenAI-compatible endpoint)

## Quick Start

### 1. Setup

```bash
git clone https://github.com/doneyli/langfuse-llm-certification-finance.git
cd langfuse-llm-certification-finance
cp .env.example .env    # Edit with your Langfuse + LLM API credentials
```

**Install dependencies** (choose one):

```bash
# Recommended: using uv (https://docs.astral.sh/uv/)
uv sync

# Alternative: using pip
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

> The examples below use `uv run` which auto-creates a virtualenv and installs
> dependencies. If you installed with pip, drop the `uv run` prefix and use
> `python` directly.

### 2. Load Sample Dataset (offline, no HuggingFace needed)

```bash
uv run python setup_datasets.py --dataset financebench --sample
```

### 3. Set Up Langfuse Configuration

```bash
uv run python setup_score_configs.py        # Register score types in Langfuse
uv run python setup_annotation_queues.py    # Create human review queue
uv run python setup_prompts.py              # Register prompt templates
```

### 4. Run Certification

```bash
uv run python run_certification.py --dataset certification/financebench-sample \
  --model claude-sonnet-4-6 --queue-failures
```

### 5. Launch the Portal

```bash
uv run python -m portal.app    # Opens on http://localhost:8050
```

### 6. View Results

Open `http://localhost:8050` for the Certification Dashboard, or Langfuse UI > **Datasets** > `certification/financebench-sample` > **Runs**

### 6. Review Failed Items

Open your Langfuse UI > **Annotation Queues** > `Certification Review` to review items that failed automated evaluation.

### 7. Export Report

```bash
uv run python export_results.py --dataset certification/financebench-sample
uv run python export_results.py --dataset certification/financebench-sample --format json --output report.json
```

## Full Dataset Mode

To load all 150 FinanceBench items from HuggingFace (requires internet):

```bash
uv run python setup_datasets.py --dataset financebench        # Downloads from HuggingFace
uv run python run_certification.py --dataset certification/financebench-v1 --model gpt-4o
```

## Components

### `setup_datasets.py` - Dataset Loader

Loads golden financial datasets into Langfuse from HuggingFace or embedded sample files.

```
Options:
  --dataset {financebench,fpb,all}   Which dataset(s) to load (default: all)
  --sample                           Use embedded sample data (offline mode)
  --prefix PREFIX                    Dataset name prefix (default: certification)
  --dry-run                          Preview without creating
```

**Supported datasets:**

| Dataset | Items | Source | Focus |
|---------|-------|--------|-------|
| `financebench` | 10 (sample) / 150 (full) | [PatronusAI/financebench](https://huggingface.co/datasets/PatronusAI/financebench) | Financial QA from SEC filings |
| `fpb` | 10 (sample) / ~4850 (full) | [ChanceFocus/en-fpb](https://huggingface.co/datasets/ChanceFocus/en-fpb) | Financial sentiment classification |

### `setup_score_configs.py` - Score Config Setup

Registers score configurations in Langfuse for all evaluators. This gives scores proper types, value ranges, and descriptions in the Langfuse UI. Also creates human review score configs for annotation queues. Idempotent — safe to re-run.

```
Options:
  --dry-run    Preview configs without creating
```

### `setup_annotation_queues.py` - Annotation Queue Setup

Creates annotation queues in Langfuse for human review of certification results. Queues are linked to the human review score configs. Requires `setup_score_configs.py` to be run first. Idempotent.

```
Options:
  --dry-run    Preview queues without creating
```

### `setup_prompts.py` - Prompt Template Setup

Registers certification prompt templates in Langfuse prompt management. Once created, prompts can be edited, versioned, and promoted in the Langfuse UI without code changes.

```
Options:
  --dry-run    Preview prompts without creating
```

**Managed prompts:**

| Prompt | Variables | Used For |
|--------|-----------|----------|
| `financial-qa` | `{{evidence}}`, `{{question}}` | FinanceBench items with filing excerpts |
| `financial-sentiment` | `{{text}}` | Financial PhraseBank sentiment classification |

### `monitor_production.py` - Production Monitor

Fetches recent production traces from Langfuse and runs deterministic evaluators (compliance, completeness) on any unscored traces. Designed to run on a schedule for continuous monitoring.

```
Options:
  --hours N              Look back N hours (default: 1)
  --tags TAG [TAG ...]   Filter traces by tags
  --trace-name NAME      Filter traces by name
  --limit N              Max traces to process (default: 100)
  --dry-run              Preview without posting scores
```

Exits with code 1 if compliance violations are detected, enabling integration with alerting systems.

### `run_certification.py` - Experiment Runner

Runs a Langfuse dataset through a model, evaluates outputs, and reports pass/fail.

```
Options:
  --dataset DATASET             Langfuse dataset name (required)
  --model MODEL                 Model to certify (default: claude-sonnet-4-6)
  --endpoint URL                LLM API base URL (for custom gateways)
  --threshold FLOAT             Pass threshold (default: 0.85)
  --max-concurrency N           Concurrent API calls (default: 5)
  --evaluators {all,...}        Which evaluators to run
  --queue-failures              Route failed items to annotation queue for human review
  --dry-run                     Preview dataset items only
  --system-prompt-file PATH     Markdown file used verbatim as the LLM system message
                                (e.g. prompts/finance_expert.md — see "Domain-Adapted
                                Variants" below)
  --label NAME                  Variant slug appended to model name in metadata + run
                                name (e.g. finance-expert). Each label becomes a
                                distinct row on the certification dashboard.
```

#### Domain-Adapted Variants

The `--system-prompt-file` + `--label` pair lets you certify the **same model with a domain-specialized system prompt** and compare it side-by-side with the baseline on the dashboard. This is *not* fine-tuning — it's prompt engineering — but for many enterprise use cases the uplift is comparable.

The repo ships one variant: **`prompts/finance_expert.md`** — a senior-financial-analyst system prompt with a 4-step CoT scaffold (identify metric → quote evidence → apply formula → state result) and FinanceBench-specific cautions (units, sign conventions, line-item confusion). On `financebench-sample` it lifts Opus 4.7 from 95% → 100%; on `financebench-v1` it's the difference between FAILED and PASSED for the same model.

Run baseline and finance-expert variants of the same model:

```bash
# Baseline
uv run python run_certification.py --dataset certification/financebench-v1 --model claude-opus-4-7

# Finance Expert variant
uv run python run_certification.py --dataset certification/financebench-v1 --model claude-opus-4-7 \
    --system-prompt-file prompts/finance_expert.md --label finance-expert
```

The dashboard groups by `metadata.model`, so the two runs appear as `claude-opus-4-7` and `claude-opus-4-7-finance-expert` — distinct rows for the comparison.

> **Future**: promote the system prompt into Langfuse prompt management (`setup_prompts.py`) once the variant graduates from demo to production tooling — gives you versioning + audit trail, matching the `financial-qa` / `financial-sentiment` pattern already in the codebase.

#### Troubleshooting: hangs on long runs

If a run silently freezes near the tail (e.g. progress to ~item 140 of 150, then stops emitting log lines for 10+ minutes with the Python process alive but consuming 0% CPU), the cause is OTel `BatchSpanProcessor` queue saturation against a slow local Langfuse — large spans (long evidence + long CoT outputs) accumulate faster than the local instance can ingest them, the export queue fills, and the pipeline deadlocks.

`run_certification.py` now sets safer OTel defaults at startup (queue 20k, batch 64, flush every 2s, export timeout 120s). To override, set the env vars before running:

```bash
OTEL_BSP_MAX_QUEUE_SIZE=20000      # default queue is 2048 — too small for 150+ items
OTEL_BSP_MAX_EXPORT_BATCH_SIZE=64  # smaller batches export faster, less queue pressure
OTEL_BSP_SCHEDULE_DELAY=2000       # flush every 2s instead of every 5s
OTEL_BSP_EXPORT_TIMEOUT=120000     # give a slow local Langfuse 2 minutes per export
LANGFUSE_FLUSH_AT=64
LANGFUSE_FLUSH_INTERVAL=2
```

The hang does not occur against Langfuse Cloud (faster ingestion). Only seen against a local self-hosted Langfuse with the full 150-item FinanceBench dataset and a CoT-heavy system prompt.

### `evaluators.py` - Financial Evaluators

Importable module of evaluation functions. All follow the Langfuse SDK signature. The pipeline uses **both** deterministic and LLM-as-a-Judge evaluators — deterministic checks handle objective, verifiable facts (number matching, prohibited phrases), while the LLM judge assesses subjective quality dimensions (groundedness, faithfulness to source documents).

**Deterministic evaluators** (fast, cheap, reproducible):

| Evaluator | Type | What It Checks |
|-----------|------|---------------|
| `numerical_accuracy_evaluator` | Item | Extracts numbers, compares with 5% tolerance |
| `exact_match_evaluator` | Item | Strict string containment |
| `sentiment_evaluator` | Item | Sentiment classification accuracy |
| `regulatory_compliance_evaluator` | Item | Scans for prohibited financial phrases |
| `response_completeness_evaluator` | Item | Response length and structure |

**LLM-as-a-Judge evaluators** (nuanced, catches qualitative failures):

| Evaluator | Type | What It Checks |
|-----------|------|---------------|
| `groundedness_evaluator` | Item | Faithfulness + completeness vs source filing evidence |

The groundedness evaluator sends the model's output, source evidence, and question to a judge model (default: `claude-sonnet-4-6`, configurable via `JUDGE_MODEL` env var) with a financial auditor rubric. It scores **faithfulness** (are claims supported by the documents?) and **completeness** (does the answer cover relevant information?), combined into a weighted score (70% faithfulness, 30% completeness). It only runs on items that include source evidence (e.g., FinanceBench).

**Run-level evaluators** (aggregate across all items):

| Evaluator | Type | What It Checks |
|-----------|------|---------------|
| `average_score_evaluator(name)` | Run | Averages a named score across all items |
| `certification_gate(name, threshold)` | Run | PASS/FAIL based on score threshold |

### `export_results.py` - Report Exporter

Exports experiment scores for compliance/AMRM report generation.

```
Options:
  --dataset DATASET          Langfuse dataset name (required)
  --run-name NAME            Specific run (default: latest)
  --format {markdown,json,csv}  Output format (default: markdown)
  --output FILE              Output file (default: stdout)
```

## Customization

### Adding Your Own Datasets

Create a JSON file with your test cases:

```json
[
  {
    "question": "What was the total revenue for FY2023?",
    "answer": "$52.6 billion",
    "justification": "From the income statement, line: Total Revenue"
  }
]
```

Then load it with `setup_datasets.py` or use the Langfuse SDK directly:

```python
from langfuse import get_client
langfuse = get_client()
langfuse.create_dataset(name="my-custom-dataset")
langfuse.create_dataset_item(
    dataset_name="my-custom-dataset",
    input={"question": "What was the total revenue for FY2023?"},
    expected_output={"answer": "$52.6 billion"},
)
```

### Adding Custom Evaluators

Add a function to `evaluators.py` following the Langfuse signature:

```python
from langfuse import Evaluation

def my_custom_evaluator(*, input, output, expected_output, **kwargs):
    # Your evaluation logic here
    score = 1.0 if "some condition" else 0.0
    return Evaluation(name="my_metric", value=score, comment="Reason")
```

Then import it in `run_certification.py`.

### Changing Pass Thresholds

```bash
uv run python run_certification.py --dataset my-dataset --threshold 0.90
```

Or modify `DEFAULT_THRESHOLD` in `evaluators.py`.

### Using a Custom LLM Gateway

```bash
# Via environment variable
export LLM_BASE_URL="https://your-gateway.internal/v1"
export LLM_API_KEY="your-key"

# Or via CLI flag
uv run python run_certification.py --endpoint https://your-gateway.internal/v1 --dataset ...
```

## Prompt Management

Certification prompts are managed in Langfuse rather than hardcoded. This enables versioning, A/B testing, and prompt updates without code changes.

### Setup

```bash
uv run python setup_prompts.py    # Creates financial-qa and financial-sentiment prompts
```

### Updating Prompts

1. Open Langfuse UI > **Prompts** > select a prompt
2. Edit the prompt text — a new immutable version is created automatically
3. Test the new version by running a certification experiment
4. Move the `production` label to the new version to deploy it
5. To roll back, reassign `production` to a previous version

The experiment runner always fetches the `production`-labeled version. If Langfuse is unavailable, it falls back to hardcoded defaults so the pipeline never breaks.

## Human Review (Annotation Queues)

The pipeline supports human-in-the-loop review for compliance sign-off and evaluator calibration.

### Setup

```bash
uv run python setup_score_configs.py        # Creates human_accuracy and human_groundedness score configs
uv run python setup_annotation_queues.py    # Creates "Certification Review" queue
```

### Routing Failed Items

Pass `--queue-failures` to automatically route low-scoring items to the annotation queue:

```bash
uv run python run_certification.py --dataset certification/financebench-sample \
  --model claude-haiku-4-5-20251001 --queue-failures
```

Items are queued when:
- The primary accuracy score is 0 (completely wrong answer)
- The groundedness score is below 0.5 (poorly grounded in source evidence)

### Reviewer Workflow

1. Open Langfuse UI > **Annotation Queues** > **Certification Review**
2. For each item, the reviewer sees the original question, the model's response, and the source evidence
3. Score `human_accuracy` (Correct / Partially Correct / Incorrect) and `human_groundedness` (Fully Grounded / Partially Grounded / Not Grounded)
4. Click **Complete + next** to proceed

Human annotations serve two purposes:
- **Compliance audit trail** — documented human sign-off on certification results
- **Evaluator calibration** — compare human scores against automated scores to validate the evaluation rubrics

## Production Monitoring

Once a model is certified and deployed, `monitor_production.py` continuously monitors live traces for compliance violations and quality degradation.

### Scheduled Monitoring

Run on a cron schedule to catch issues in real-time:

```bash
# Every 15 minutes, check the last hour of production traces
*/15 * * * * cd /path/to/repo && uv run python monitor_production.py --hours 1 --tags production

# Or filter by your application's trace name
*/15 * * * * cd /path/to/repo && uv run python monitor_production.py --trace-name my-finance-app
```

### How It Works

1. Fetches recent traces from the Langfuse API (filtered by time window, tags, or trace name)
2. Skips traces that already have compliance scores (idempotent)
3. Runs `regulatory_compliance` and `completeness` evaluators on each trace
4. Posts scores back to Langfuse
5. Reports any compliance violations and exits with code 1 (for alerting integration)

### Online LLM-as-a-Judge (via Langfuse UI)

For subjective quality monitoring (groundedness, helpfulness), configure LLM-as-a-Judge evaluators directly in the Langfuse UI:

1. Go to **Evaluators** > **Set up Evaluator**
2. Select a managed evaluator (e.g., Hallucination, Helpfulness) or create a custom one
3. Choose "Live Observations" as the target and filter to your production traces
4. Set a sampling rate (e.g., 10%) to manage cost
5. Langfuse runs the judge automatically on matching observations

See [Langfuse LLM-as-a-Judge docs](https://langfuse.com/docs/evaluation/evaluation-methods/llm-as-a-judge) for details.

## CI/CD Integration

### CLI Gate

Use `--ci` to fail the process on certification failure (exit code 1):

```bash
uv run python run_certification.py \
  --dataset certification/financebench-sample \
  --model claude-haiku-4-5-20251001 \
  --threshold 0.85 \
  --ci
```

### Pytest Gate

`tests/test_certification.py` provides pytest tests that run certification experiments and assert pass/fail:

```bash
# Run all certification tests
uv run pytest tests/test_certification.py -v

# Run only FinanceBench tests
uv run pytest tests/test_certification.py -v -k financebench

# Override model and threshold via env vars
CERT_MODEL=claude-sonnet-4-6 CERT_THRESHOLD=0.90 uv run pytest tests/test_certification.py -v
```

Tests cover:
- `TestFinanceBenchCertification::test_numerical_accuracy_meets_threshold`
- `TestFinanceBenchCertification::test_regulatory_compliance`
- `TestFPBCertification::test_sentiment_accuracy_meets_threshold`

### GitHub Actions

`.github/workflows/certification.yml` provides automated certification:

- **Triggers:** manual dispatch (with configurable model/threshold) and push to `main` when evaluators, prompts, or certification config change
- **Jobs:** runs FinanceBench and FPB certification in parallel, then runs the pytest gate
- **Secrets required:** `LANGFUSE_PUBLIC_KEY`, `LANGFUSE_SECRET_KEY`, `LANGFUSE_BASE_URL`, `ANTHROPIC_API_KEY`

To trigger manually: **Actions** > **LLM Certification** > **Run workflow** > choose model and threshold.

## Expanding to More Financial Datasets

The [Open FinLLM Leaderboard](https://huggingface.co/spaces/TheFinAI/Open-Financial-LLM-Leaderboard) provides 40+ financial datasets. Good next candidates:

| Dataset | Focus | HuggingFace ID |
|---------|-------|----------------|
| FLARE FinQA | Numerical reasoning over financial tables | `ChanceFocus/flare-finqa` |
| FLARE FOMC | Monetary policy stance classification | `ChanceFocus/flare-fomc` |
| Credit Risk (German) | Credit scoring | `ChanceFocus/flare-german` |
| Credit Risk (Taiwan) | Credit risk assessment | `TheFinAI/cra-taiwan` |
| TATQA | Table + text hybrid QA | `ChanceFocus/flare-tatqa` |

## Certification Portal

A web dashboard for business and compliance stakeholders to view certification status at a glance.

The UI is a React SPA built with [Click UI](https://clickhouse.design/click-ui), the official ClickHouse design system. FastAPI exposes the JSON API and serves the built SPA.

### Running the Portal

```bash
# First time: build the frontend
cd portal/frontend && npm install && npm run build && cd ../..

uv run python -m portal.app                     # Default: http://localhost:8050
PORTAL_PORT=9000 uv run python -m portal.app    # Custom port
```

### Frontend development (live reload)

```bash
# Terminal 1: API
uv run python -m portal.app

# Terminal 2: Vite dev server — proxies /api to :8050
cd portal/frontend && npm run dev        # http://localhost:5173
```

### Pages

| Page | URL | Description |
|------|-----|-------------|
| Dashboard | `/` | Certification matrix — which models pass/fail against which datasets |
| Breakdown | `/breakdown/{dataset}/{run}` | Evaluator scores (bar chart + table) for a specific run |
| History | `/history/{dataset}` | Timeline of all runs with trend chart |
| Run Detail | `/run/{dataset}/{run}` | Per-item scores with links to Langfuse traces |

### JSON API

All pages have corresponding JSON endpoints under `/api/`:

```bash
curl http://localhost:8050/api/dashboard | python -m json.tool
curl http://localhost:8050/api/history/certification/financebench-sample
```

The portal reads live data from your Langfuse instance (same `LANGFUSE_*` credentials) with a 60-second TTL cache.

### Portal vs Langfuse Dashboards

Some metrics can also be visualized using [Langfuse Custom Dashboards](https://langfuse.com/docs/metrics/features/custom-dashboards) (created in the UI — no API for dashboard creation). Use both:

| What to track | Where | Why |
|---|---|---|
| Score trends over time | **Langfuse dashboard** | Native widget: `scores-numeric` view, dimension `name`, time granularity `day` |
| Compliance violations | **Langfuse dashboard** | Native widget: filter `name=regulatory_compliance`, count where value=0 |
| Cost & latency by model | **Langfuse dashboard** | Native widget: `observations` view, dimension `providedModelName` |
| Pass/fail certification matrix | **Portal** | Langfuse can't join dataset run metadata to scores or show threshold-based badges |
| Run-level aggregation per experiment | **Portal** | Dashboards query individual scores, not scoped to a specific dataset run |
| Per-item drill-down with all scores | **Portal** | Dashboards show aggregate charts, not item-level tables |
| Run history & trend by dataset | **Portal** | No dataset run concept in the dashboard query engine |

**Recommended Langfuse dashboard setup** (create manually in UI > Dashboards > New):
1. **Avg scores over time** — line chart, `scores-numeric` view, measure `avg(value)`, dimension `name`, time granularity `day`
2. **Compliance violations** — bar chart, `scores-numeric` view, filter `name=regulatory_compliance`, filter `value=0`, measure `count`
3. **Score distribution** — bar chart, `scores-numeric` view, measure `avg(value)`, dimension `name`
4. **Cost by model** — bar chart, `observations` view, measure `sum(totalCost)`, dimension `providedModelName`

## Environment Variables

| Variable | Required | Default | Description |

| `LANGFUSE_BASE_URL` | No | `https://cloud.langfuse.com` | Langfuse instance URL |
| `ANTHROPIC_API_KEY` | For Claude models | — | Anthropic API key for Claude models |
| `LLM_API_KEY` | For OpenAI models | — | OpenAI-compatible API key |
| `LLM_BASE_URL` | No | `https://api.openai.com/v1` | LLM API base URL |
| `LLM_MODEL` | No | `claude-sonnet-4-6` | Default model to certify |
| `JUDGE_MODEL` | No | `claude-sonnet-4-6` | Model used by LLM-as-a-Judge evaluators |

## FAQ

### How does certification scoring work?

The pipeline runs the model under test against every item in a Langfuse dataset, then scores each response with a set of evaluators. Scores are aggregated at the run level, and a **certification gate** checks whether the primary accuracy metric meets the configured threshold (default: 85%). The model either PASSES or FAILS.

### Are the evaluators deterministic or LLM-based?

Both. The pipeline uses **deterministic evaluators** (regex, string matching, number extraction) for objective metrics and an **LLM-as-a-Judge evaluator** (`groundedness_evaluator`) for subjective quality assessment. Deterministic evaluators are fast, cheap, and reproducible. The LLM judge catches qualitative failures that heuristics miss — like whether the model hallucinated a number that happens to be correct, or whether it actually used the source documents.

### Why use both types of evaluators?

They cover different failure modes. For example, in our Haiku certification run:
- **Numerical accuracy** (deterministic): 60% — Haiku often gets the numbers wrong
- **Groundedness** (LLM judge): 97% — but when it has evidence, it faithfully uses it

Without the LLM judge, you'd just see "60%, FAILED" and assume the model is unreliable. With it, you can see the failure is specifically in numerical reasoning, not in faithfulness to source material. That distinction matters for model risk assessments.

### Where do certification results appear in Langfuse?

- **Item-level scores** (numerical_accuracy, groundedness, etc.) appear on each trace under the dataset run in **Datasets > [dataset] > Runs**
- **Run-level scores** (certification_result, avg_numerical_accuracy, avg_groundedness) are persisted as scores on the first experiment trace. You can find them by searching for scores named `certification_result` in the Langfuse Scores view, or by clicking into any trace from the dataset run.

### Can I use a different judge model?

Yes. Set the `JUDGE_MODEL` environment variable:

```bash
JUDGE_MODEL=claude-haiku-4-5-20251001 uv run python run_certification.py --dataset ...
```

Using a cheaper/faster judge model reduces cost but may lower evaluation quality. We recommend using a model at least as capable as `claude-sonnet-4-6` for financial evaluations.

### How do I add my own evaluator?

Add a function to `evaluators.py` following the Langfuse SDK signature:

```python
from langfuse import Evaluation

def my_custom_evaluator(*, input, output, expected_output, **kwargs):
    score = 1.0 if "some condition" else 0.0
    return Evaluation(name="my_metric", value=score, comment="Reason")
```

Then import it in `run_certification.py` and add it to `select_evaluators()`.

### What's the difference between item-level and run-level evaluators?

- **Item-level** evaluators score each dataset item individually (e.g., "did this answer match the expected number?")
- **Run-level** evaluators aggregate across all items (e.g., "what was the average accuracy?" or "did the model pass certification?")

### What datasets are supported?

Currently two financial benchmarks are included:

| Dataset | Items | Focus |
|---------|-------|-------|
| [FinanceBench](https://huggingface.co/datasets/PatronusAI/financebench) | 10 (sample) / 150 (full) | Financial QA from SEC filings |
| [Financial PhraseBank](https://huggingface.co/datasets/ChanceFocus/en-fpb) | 10 (sample) / ~4850 (full) | Financial sentiment classification |

You can add custom datasets — see the [Customization](#customization) section.
